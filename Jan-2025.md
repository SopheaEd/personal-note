__Feeling passion about Anthropology__ 

I feel motivated and want be a anthropologist when I read the drafted question from Eve about human health and pesticide. She drafted questionns for interviewing Nak Banh Tnam. I read it and it's so clean and deep thinking. Those questions remind me how specific and deep thought look like. It's so details, precise questions to ask Nak Banh Tnam. The questions consist xxx parts including demographic information, socio-economic activities, agriculture, pesticide application, health, and future expectation or goal. 

Before I get envolved in this project, I used to think that the quantitative methods is better than ethnographic apprpoach. This because I don't know anything about this work. Now, I am curious about it. I want to attach myself to both methods and make something special. I feel that I get close 20% what I want to be.
