- Farmers have their own knowledge on how to use, project, dealth with problems of pesticides
- __Nak Banh Thnam__
  - Drone can not replace the Nak Banh Thnam completely because 1) drones spray pesticides and broadcast the *Chhi* NOT effeciently due to ownership of the drone belonging to businessman; 2) `5 <` drone owners are not willing to sprays on land less than 3-4 hectares.
  - Farmers mixed different types of pesticides for purposes including killing herbs, insects, pests, and diseases at the same *Thong Banh Thnam*
  - Farmers seem to not willing to read the labels or instruction before applying the pesticides.

- Learn how to observe NOT response in a way of personal perception
- Learn how to communicate effectively with farmers in term of diliver the message, questions, and explaination.
- What I have learned from the intervie today?
  - The total land for each farmers are 40-80 hectares
  - The most of the land they rented from private (rich person) and state land for 250$ per hectares. For farmer did not join the community or did not rent the land from the private, in case they want to pump water from the cannels, they need to pay around 25 dollar per rice cycle.
  - For Sre Luer, If there is water shorage, farmer can buy water from Stream (Stueng) where the private company pumps from the Stueng and sells for $100 per hectare.
  - People grow 3 times per year, 2 times in dry season [Sre Kroum] and 1 time for rainy season [Sre Luer]
  - Farmers tend to use some varieties Pka Romdoul, xxx , in rainny season
  - 5451 and 85 are common rice variety for dry season.
  - The decision for the next season for growing rice based on observation rice price, market demands, rice yields, xx, the current year.
  - Rice farmers are now using machines:
     - Tractors - for plowing
     - Kou Yuns - transport rice yields, spray pesticide, broadcasting seeds and chemical fertilizers, and pump waters
     - Pumping machines - pump out the water from and in rice field
     - Drone - rent drone for spraying chemical pesticides, fertilizers, broadcast seeds, in case farmer did not have enough time and labor for docing these activities.
     - Rice harvester - farmers spend around 30 0000 Riels for Sre Leur and 23 0000 for Sre Kroum because Srey Koum has big size and easy to harvest.
     - There are four types of soils in the research area. Those are 1) No.1 soil (Kandeang soil - the soil in zone three with highest nutrients), No.2 soil (Kandeang mixed with sands - located in zone two from the river); No. 3 Sands(zone 1)
     - The quality of the soils based on the xx river floods. If there is a big flood, people will happy because it brings nutrient to their rice field. For the good duration for the food up 20-30 days, it will good for rice after it Srok.
     - But if their rice are growing and the flood come for 10 or more, rice will be gone due to the water is a salty [Tuek Brai]
     - Comparing to river flood, the Stream flood is good quality and NOT much affect their rice. The rice retains up to 10 or 15 days.

__Feeling passion about Anthropology__ 

I feel motivated and want be a anthropologist when I read the drafted question from Eve about human health and pesticide. She drafted questionns for interviewing Nak Banh Tnam. I read it and it's so clean and deep thinking. Those questions remind me how specific and deep thought look like. It's so details, precise questions to ask Nak Banh Tnam. The questions consist xxx parts including demographic information, socio-economic activities, agriculture, pesticide application, health, and future expectation or goal. 

Before I get envolved in this project, I used to think that the quantitative methods is better than ethnographic apprpoach. This because I don't know anything about this work. Now, I am curious about it. I want to attach myself to both methods and make something special. I feel that I get close 20% what I want to be.
